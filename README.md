In this project, I demonstrate aptitude of NoSQL databases with MongoDB, the leading database management system for this language. I expanded my skills working with non-relational documents, utilizing the PyMongo library to interface with Mongo databases using Python. Data was imported from a UK restaurant review publication, Eat Safe, Love, where I then made explorative analysis queries, including geo-location data, all using PyMongo. I also built an aggregation pipeline to retrieve queried data.  Leading up to this project I integrated skills I previously learned, such as Pandas, APIs, and Matplotlib, with Mongo databases and queries.
